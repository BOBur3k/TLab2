## Project Intro/Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze data and assist the user in obtaining important information regarding the average and median prices of a stock. As an example, we have used the stock performance of $AMZN from March 2 to April 27. The current code can also calculate the standard deviation for the same data.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics

### Technologies
* Python 

## Project Description
This piece of code utilizes the concept of for loops to perform data manipulations and computations instead of relying on statistical packages such as statistics, pandas, or numphy. The code is designed to handle empty datasets seamlessly and to work with accurate data. It ensures that the computations are performed on the correct data and the results produced are reliable.
